            <div>
                <p>I am the second of four children. I am originally from a small town in Louisiana. I relocated to Texas with my son in December 2021 for work. I absolutely love it here, but the heat can be intense in the summer months.
                </p>
                <p>My career field before software development was healthcare. I became a Licensed Practical/ Vocational Nurse August 2019. I returned to school to obtain my associates in Registered Nurse and became a Registered Nurse January 2022. My specialties include cardiac, medical surgical, and intensive care (ICU).</p>
                <p>I decided to pursue a career in software development for the flexibility that the career offers. I am able to still think critically in this job. I am still solving complex problems, but there is much more room for creativity and independence.</p>
                <p>I am excited for my journey! I am loving the progress I am making this far.</p>
